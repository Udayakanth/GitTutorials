* Git Learning
** Basics
    - First time install git-scm

** Config
    - git --version
    - $ git --version
      git version 2.9.2.windows.1
    - SET CONFIG VALUES
    - git config --global user.name "your name"
    - git config --user.email "id@company.com"
    - git config --list
    - NEED HELP?
    - git help <verb>
    - git <verb> --help

** Initialization
    - git init
    - git status // to get the current tracking info of the project You are
      working
    - touch .gitignore //creates .gitignore file
    - .gitignore file contains file names which we dont want to track
    - ex: config (personnel preference file) ( font, font size, debug files .DS_Store...)
    - wild card entry is possible in .gitignore file, ex: *.txt, does not track
      all text files in current working directory // note this is not recursive
    - in .gitignore folder/abc/def.pdf, ignore def.pdf in folder/abc/
    - You have to manually enter the folder with file name which You don't want
      to track
    - git status -s // argument -s shows status in one line
      A  one.cpp

** Work Flow
    - 3 stages, 2 steps
    - working directory to staging area to final revision
      - step 1: working directory to staging area
      - git add -A // adds from working dir to stage area
      - if You want to remove files from staging area then enter command $ git reset
      - $git reset fileName // its a reverse process of working to staging area, its
        staging to working area
      - step 2: staging area to final revision
      - git commit -m " commit msg, what changes are made in this revision"

** Woking On Remote Project 
      - git clone <url> <where to clone>
      - git clone https://link.to.repository.git . // . indicates current directory
      - cloning can be done locally, from one folder to another folder
      - git clone /folder/abc /folder/def
      - git clone /folder/abc . // clone to current directory

** Commiting changes to Remote repository
      - git status; git add -A; git -m "changes"; then
      - git pull repoNameInGitHub master
      - pull is because any other developer changes made to the repository will
        be included to Your project, so that every developer will be workin on
        latest (recent) code
      - master indicates we are pulling data from master branch
      - git push repoNameInGitHub master
      - master indicates we are commiting to master branch

** Common Work Flow
    - create a branch for desired feature
    - git branch branchName //creates a branch
    - git branch -a // to view all branches in project
    - git checkout branchName //switches brach to given branch
    -

    - branching and merging info in text can be done by following command
    - git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
    - git log --graph give detailed branching and merging with commit message
